# VSCODE_NEURO

Collection of extensions and settings for VSCode to make it more suitable for working with Neuroimaging data. The repository is a work in progress and will be updated as I find new extensions or settings that are useful for working with Neuroimaging data. Available extensions are listed below, inspect their respective directories for more information.
